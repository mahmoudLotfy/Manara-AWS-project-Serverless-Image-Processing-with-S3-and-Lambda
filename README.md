Description:
Create a serverless image processing application where users upload images to an S3 bucket, triggering an AWS Lambda function that processes and resizes the images before storing them in another S3 bucket.

Key AWS Services Used:
Amazon S3: Stores original and processed images.
AWS Lambda: Executes image processing (resize).

Learning Outcomes:
Building event-driven architectures with Lambda and S3 triggers.
Understanding cost-efficient, auto-scaling serverless applications.
Enhancing security using IAM roles and S3 bucket policies.
